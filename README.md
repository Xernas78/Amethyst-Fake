# Fake Glowstone
A Glowstone version of a Fake Minecraft server that only appears in server list ping (SLP)

You just have to download the last release and execute the jar file like any other jar file

## server.properties

Then you can modify server.properties which has 4 properties:
- players_max
- players_online
- version_name
- version_protocol

## MOTD

You can also modify the motd.json file which is the MOTD of the server !
It has a chat component format in JSON just like the chat message format at https://wiki.vg/Chat#Current_system_.28JSON_Chat.29

## Favicon

You can also add the favicon of the server by adding a 64x64 icon.png file to your server directory.

### Thanks to https://wiki.vg for all the resources that helped me make this project
